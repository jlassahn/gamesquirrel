== Preface

TODO This is a book describing the details of the GameSquirrel system software.

== Memory Organization

The GameSquirrel has three kinds of system memory:
* 272KBytes of fast SRAM.
* 512KBytes of Flash ROM 
* 4MBytes of slow RAM.

=== Slow RAM

The main memory of the GameSquirrel is a serial RAM chip which provides 4
Megabytes of space.  The game's code and general data are loaded here by
the system software.

The maximum speed of the main memory is about 48 Megabytes per second, which
is much slower than the 240MHz main processor.
